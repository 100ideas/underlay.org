# Overview

R1 is a registry of Underlay data collections, designed to capture workflows for data governance and reuse.    

Here you will find pipeline tools for [creating](../new) and updating collections, and managing and describing their lifecycle.

While this is a centralized registry, for us to explore friendly and accessible UIs for working with collections, we are designing for a future where anyone can run a local collection server to effectively interface with regional or global registry services.
