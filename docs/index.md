# Overview

R1 is a registry of Underlay data collections, designed to capture workflows for data governance and reuse. Here you will find pipeline tools for [creating](../new) and updating collections and their schemas, and managing and describing their lifecycle.

While this demo is effectively a central registry, we are designing for a future where anyone can run a local collection server to effectively interface with regional or global registry services.

* _Schemas_: [Examples](../agnes) and [documentation](docs/)
